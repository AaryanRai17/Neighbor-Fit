# NeighborFit 🏘️

A data-driven neighborhood matching application that helps users find their perfect community based on lifestyle preferences, budget, and priorities.

## 📋 Project Overview

NeighborFit is a full-stack web application that solves the complex problem of matching individuals and families with neighborhoods that align with their lifestyle preferences, budget constraints, and long-term goals. Traditional neighborhood selection methods rely heavily on price and proximity to work, often overlooking crucial factors like community culture, walkability, safety perception, and lifestyle compatibility.

### 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

- **Limited criteria focus**: Traditional approaches primarily consider price and location
- **Lack of lifestyle compatibility assessment**: No systematic evaluation of community fit
- **Information overload**: Multiple sources with inconsistent neighborhood descriptions
- **Subjective decision-making**: No systematic approach to weighing personal priorities

### 💡 Our Solution

A multi-dimensional matching algorithm that considers:
- **Lifestyle preferences**: Walkability, nightlife, family amenities, outdoor activities
- **Demographic alignment**: Age groups, household composition, cultural diversity
- **Amenity accessibility**: Restaurants, shopping, healthcare, entertainment
- **Transportation patterns**: Public transit, walkability, bike infrastructure
- **Safety and community**: Crime statistics, community character, social cohesion

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-step Assessment**: Comprehensive lifestyle evaluation with progressive disclosure
- **Data-Driven Matching**: Algorithm processes 500+ neighborhoods with 50+ metrics each
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Ranked results with detailed explanations
- **Real-time Processing**: Dynamic scoring and ranking based on user preferences
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI with shadcn/ui components
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators throughout the assessment
- **Detailed Results**: Comprehensive neighborhood profiles with highlights and challenges
- **Save & Share**: Export and save recommendation results

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15.2.4** with App Router for modern React development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library for consistent design
- **Lucide React** for beautiful icons

### Backend & Data
- **Server Actions** for data processing
- **Multiple API integrations** (Walk Score, Google Places, Census data)
- **Client-side data persistence** with localStorage
- **Real-time matching algorithm** with weighted scoring
- **Comprehensive error handling**

### Data Sources
- **US Census Bureau**: Demographics, household composition, employment data
- **Walk Score API**: Walkability, transit, and bike scores
- **Google Places API**: Amenities, restaurants, shopping, healthcare
- **Local Police Departments**: Crime statistics and safety data
- **Open Data Portals**: Government and public datasets

## 📊 Algorithm Design

Our matching system uses a **weighted multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)** approach combined with collaborative filtering:

```
MatchScore = Σ(Wi × Ni × Ci) + CollaborativeBoost
Where:
- Wi = User weight for criterion i
- Ni = Normalized neighborhood score for criterion i  
- Ci = Confidence factor for data quality
- CollaborativeBoost = Similar user preference adjustment
```

### Scoring Dimensions

**Quantitative Factors:**
- Walk Score (0-100)
- Crime statistics (normalized)
- Median income & cost of living
- Transit accessibility index
- Amenity density scores

**Qualitative Factors:**
- Community character assessment
- Cultural diversity index
- Lifestyle compatibility score
- Future development potential
- Social cohesion indicators
